# Onthisday

> ðŸ“† Javascript fetcher for Wikipedia "On this day" events.

## Getting Started

A script used to fetch events from wikipedia for a specific day (today by default).

## Usage

```
yarn start [-a|--all] [-h|--html]
```
Options:

    --all Used to get all wikipedia events

    --html When defined return the html value with links



In `./sources/aws.js` in an script example to deploy it on AWS.

[Here is a test API.](https://eh8jjia7j5.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/prod/events)

Possible query parameters:
    - lang: language to fetch (`en` or `fr` for now)
    - day: day for date to fetch (default is today)
    - month: month for date to fetch (default is today)
    - html: returns html content
    - all: returns all wikipedia's events

Do not flood the API, I will shut it down otherwise...
